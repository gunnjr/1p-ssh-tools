# 1Password SSH Tools (Staging)

This repo is a staging area for scripts and utilities that automate
SSH key management and 1Password CLI workflows.

## Current Objective
Keep this isolated from the bootstrap environment.
As the scripts mature, they'll be cleaned, documented,
and published as an open-source toolkit.

### Scripts to Stage
- `op-gen-ssh-pubonly.sh`
- `op-provision-ssh-host.sh`
- `op-ssh-smart.sh` (future)
- Supporting README and example config files.
